The history of the United States started with the arrival of Native Americans in North America 
around 15,000 BC. Numerous indigenous cultures formed, and many disappeared in the 1500s.
The arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas.
Most colonies were formed after 1600, and United States was the first nation whose most 
distant origins are fully recorded.[a] By the 1760s, the thirteen British colonies contained 
2.5 million people along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains.
After defeating France, the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the
Stamp Act of 1765, rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed 
their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the Boston Tea Party in 1773, 
led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end self-government. Armed conflict 
began in Massachusetts in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress 
declared the independence of the colonies as the "United States". Led by General 
George Washington, it won the Revolutionary War. The peace treaty of 1783 established 
the borders of the new nation. The Articles of Confederation established a central government, 
but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no 
executive officer. A convention wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789 and a Bill of
Rights was added in 1791 to guarantee inalienable rights. With Washington as the first 
president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created.
Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States.
